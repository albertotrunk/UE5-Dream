# Why UE5-Dream?

- The main idea is to improve the workflows and the quality in Unreal Engine with a Stable diffusion plugin

Very useful for learning, for improve quality, get inspiration...
Amazing for the workflow for indies, little studios or big, from prototyping to the final art



- The power of dream resides in to customize you own model according to the project, makes no sense to use other artist than yours for example:

This is my game, so I did train a model using 3d as dataset, like:

Then I can obtain according my own prompt based on training inspiration for my game.
For example I want to make In unreal a market area and a hotel so, the AI helps me with that:

- Now let's see how looks in real!

- But the old town was destroyed time ago by a zombie horde! 
Not a problem we can just mix the style with Quixel abandoned apartment and get inspired!

And I mix both styles
