What?? Why?? How??

UE5 Stable Diffusion plugin makes Unreal Engine an unlimited AI-enhanced tool, and is not just a 3D tool anymore.

Based on [**Stability.Ai Stable Diffusion**](https://stability.ai/) and using a specially trained model for weights, 
is fully integrated into the Unreal editor menu, coded with [Unreal Engine Python API](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PythonAPI/), 
and loading the special python packages for the editor when is possible.

**How it works:**

Easy! Just click on the Main Menu -> Dream

Text what you want and Unreal will do the rest in some minutes!

For example:

- I need a concept, simple as text something like: "A concept art of a beautiful city, fantasy, trending on artstation":

- I want to do an ancient greek temple, but I need some guide... so I text: "Realistic documentary landscape photo a the ancient acropolis"

- There is a limit for a dream? I don't think so...
