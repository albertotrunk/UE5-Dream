# UE5-Dream
UE5 Stable Diffusion Plugin the Dream project! 

Currently the code is private, 
but is going to be open-source and free-for-all very soon!

What?? Why?? How??

UE5 Stable Diffusion plugin makes Unreal Engine an unlimited AI-enhanced tool, and is not just a 3D tool anymore.

Based on [**Stability.Ai Stable Diffusion**](https://stability.ai/) and using a specially trained model for weights, 
is fully integrated into the Unreal editor menu, coded with [Unreal Engine Python API](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PythonAPI/), 
and loading the special python packages for the editor when is possible.

**How it works:**

Easy! Just click on the Main Menu -> Dream
Text what you want and Unreal will do the rest in some minutes!

For example:

- I need a concept, simple as that:

- I want to do an ancient greek temple, but I need some guide... so I text: "Realistic documentary landscape photo a the ancient acropolis"

**Of course you need a good hardware to make it work!**
