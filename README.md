LET'S DREAM!
UE5 Stable Diffusion plugin makes Unreal Engine an unlimited AI-enhanced tool, and is not just a 3D tool anymore.

Based on [**Stability.Ai Stable Diffusion**](https://stability.ai/) and using a specially trained model for weights, 
is fully integrated into the Unreal editor menu, coded with [Unreal Engine Python API](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/PythonAPI/), 
and loading the special python packages for the editor when is possible.
